	Trivial - null, undefined
	composite - objects(array, functions, key/values)
	
	typeof function is used to identify the type of data.

	all function arguments are passed by value. it means copies values of the variables that you pass to function into local variables. any changes on function local variable inside the function its not affect the argument you passed.

copy by reference:
	function arguments passed by reference, the changes of varibales that you pass to function will reflected on outside the function.
